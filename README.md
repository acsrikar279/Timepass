# python-gvp-results-grabber
My Python project to extract the GPA of people and make a bar graph. Even if it is used for single person, it generates a barplot for that one value. Please give the values seperated by spaces like 15131a0509 15131a0539 and so on. The time it takes to fetch the result and generate a graph is proportional to the network speed you have. So be patient if you are on a slow network.
