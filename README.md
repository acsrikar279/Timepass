# python-gvp-results-grabber
These python files are to extract the GPA of people and make a bar graph. 
###5thsem.py
Even if it is used for single person, it generates a barplot for that one value. Please give the values seperated by spaces like 15131a0509 15131a0539 and so on. The time it takes to fetch the result and generate a graph is proportional to the network speed you have. So be patient if you are on a slow network.
###anyresults.py
It exracts results of a person from any one of the sem depending upon the choice.
