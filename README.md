# Timepass Things

### 5thsem.py
Even if it is used for single person, it generates a barplot for that one value. Please give the values seperated by spaces like 15131a0509 15131a0539 and so on. The time it takes to fetch the result and generate a graph is proportional to the network speed you have. So be patient if you are on a slow network.

### anyresults.py
It extracts results of a person from any one of the sem depending upon the choice.

### collect_tweets.py
It is used to retrieve the tweets by an user using the key as Username (For Example, Pawan Kalyan's Twitter username is PawanKalyan)
